For 100% hit rate it is sufficient to have references ids set with cardinality not more than page frame,
while accessing any order.
Great increase can be achieved via consecutive increasing/decreasing id accessing,
if cardinality is more than a page frame (rate decreases greater the cardinality is).
In both cases we have all or some pages always in memory when constantly accessing only it.

For low hit rate we may have ids set with cardinality more than page frame and access ids in inc/dec crossing manner,
e. g. <1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998,...>.
For this case we will rarely have any hit, only when sequences converge – <...500, 501, 501, 500,...>,
if ids set cardinality is same order of page frame. If at least 2 times plus 1 more, we have 0% hit rate.
